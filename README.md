# My Brackets extensions

Just a repo to track and sync my [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) extensions through all my computers. Take it as my recommandation on what brackets extensions are worth trying.

I am using [Team Extensions by WebPad](https://www.genuitec.com/products/webpad/teamext/) to manage extensions. The file ``.team.extensions`` contains a json containing all the information needed by Team Extensions to install the needed extentions in Brackets.

## Instructions

- Download and install [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)
- Find the [Team Extensions by WebPad](https://www.genuitec.com/products/webpad/teamext/) extension in the extension manager and click install.
- Clone this repo and open it in Brackets.
- Open the extension manager and klick the icon **Team**
- Click **Install All** or just explore the Team extensions and install the ones that make sense for your work.

Optionally you can first fork the repo and use your fork to manage, share and sync your prefered extensions on Github.
